/*
 * BackSync
 *
 * In this challenge, the application makes periodically an 
 * HTTP GET request to a URL (new at each launch): 'http://xxxdeletedoldstagingsite.com/remoteConfig'.
 * This "remoteConfig" should be a JSON containing "mode" and "target_url" keys. For "mode" the value
 * should be "collect_logs", while "target_url" is the URL to which send the flag in a subsequent
 * POST request. 
 * 
 * At startup, the application write the flag in a file (in macOS - which I used to solve the challenge -
 * under "/Users/<user>/Documents/flag.txt") and the content of this file is sent as the application/json
 * request body to "target_url".
 *
 * So to solve is just sufficient to add an entry to /etc/hosts and let de domain be resovled, 
 * startup a web server at that IP (for instance, localhost) and serve "remoteConfig" file.
 * Then the app makes a POST HTTP request sending: 
 * {"flag":"FLAG{you_remotely_triggered_the_leak}"}
 *
 * Cheers
